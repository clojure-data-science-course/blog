Here are some suggestions -- let us discuss them if you are interested. Some of these are already looked upon by someone, but you may be very welcome to join.

## Working with R

Clojure is arguably the best way to work with data, but it does not have the richness of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) in terms of statistics and visualization libraries. In a senses, R is a lisp too. This means that combining the two may be a special delight. 

There have been several libraries for calling R from Clojure. Our goal in the following projects is to document them with cool examples, extend them, and possibly unify them in some way.

### visualizations with gg4clj

The ggplot2 library is the most used visualization library in the R community.
It has lots of extensions for various use cases.

gg4clj is a clojure wrapper for ggplot2.
It allows to write ggplot2 visualizations using clojure datastructures.
It was extended by huri that added some functions for common use cases.

In this project, we will study ggplot2 and gg4clj by writing examples, and possibly extend gg4clj.

Possible plan:
- Play with gg4clj inside Gorilla REPL
- Look into ggplot2 and some of its extensions. Read some their tutorials, and translate them to gg4clj. Play.
- Create some Gorilla worksheets with interesting examples you found. Publish them using the online viewer. This will make the community happy!
- Team with a data scientist and choose an interesting dataset.
- Create some visualizations together, and publish as a worksheet.

## Working with Python
