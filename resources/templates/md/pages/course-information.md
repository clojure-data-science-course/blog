## Groups

- We divide into two small groups, of up to 14 people each.
- **Group A** members are mainly data scientists, some new to clojure. Thus the meetings orientation will be **"clojure for data scientists"**.
- **Group B** members are mainly clojurians, some new to data science. Thus the meetings orientation will be **"data science for clojurians"**.


## Meetings

Every 3 weeks we have two similar meetings -- one for each group. They are held in English, unless everybody are Hebrew speakers.

- Group A: Sun 18:00-21:00 every 3 weeks
- Group B: Wed 18:00-21:00 every 3 weeks

If people feel like it, we will have occasional meetings for doing homework and training together.

In about 6 meetings, people should gain some reasonable practical independence with the language. We will have at least 12 meetings. Then, we may decide to continue with more advanced topics.
