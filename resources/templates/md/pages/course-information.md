This website holds general information and course materials for the Clojure Data Science Course that  began in Tel Aviv towards the end of 2018.

The course is being organized by the [local meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Clojure-Israel/). Several members have been contributing to the course.


## Meetings

[Meeting A1](https://www.meetup.com/Clojure-Israel/events/255927870/) - Nov 25th 2018

[Meeting B1](https://www.meetup.com/Clojure-Israel/events/256159018/) - Nov 28th 2018

## Introduction 

Are you a data scientist or analyst looking for new tools and new ways of thought? Are you curious to know what Clojure is? Then this free course is for you.

Are you an experienced Clojurian, curious about data science? Then you are invited too -- you will probably find this interesting and useful as well.

Clojure is a programming language. It presents a unique blend of Computer Science paradigms, mainly Lisp and Functional Programming. It also offers a certain culture of thought, which calls for simplicity, focus on data, interactive experience and a dynamic flow of creativity. The fusion of all these allows for a rather joyful programming experience.

The purpose of this course is to study Clojure as a practical tool for data science.

## Goals

- Create a study group -- a team of people willing to think and learn together.
- Have fun.
- Study new methods and tools.
- In few months, create a group of people who love to do data science using Clojure.
- Work together on improving the open source ecosystem for data science in clojure.

## What should I do to join the course?
- Please contact the [course organizer](https://www.meetup.com/Clojure-Israel/members/63580692/) in person.

## The format

- We will divide into two small groups, of up to 14 people each.
- Every 3 weeks we will have two similar meetings -- one for each group. They will probably be held in English (unless everybody are Hebrew speakers).
- Group A members are mainly data scientists, some new to clojure. Thus the meetings orientation will be "clojure for data scientists".
- Group B members are mainly clojurians, some new to data science. Thus the meetings orientation will be "data science for clojurians".
- In about 6 meetings, people should gain some reasonable practical independence with the language.
- We will have at least 12 meetings -- that is, till the middle of the summer. Then, we may decide to continue with more advanced topics.
