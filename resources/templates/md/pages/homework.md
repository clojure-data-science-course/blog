Homework in this course will be mostly personal. We will work in small teams of 1-3 people, and take on small projects that match each person's special interests and background.

You may find some suggestions for personal homework at the [Suggested Projects](../suggested-projects) page.

However, here are some general homework.

## Meeting 1 - intro to clojure

1. Install Gorilla REPL and play with it. See the [Software](../software/) section.

2. Read [clojinc](http://viewer.gorilla-repl.org/view.html?source=github&user=lspector&repo=clojinc&path=worksheet.clj) by Lee Spector. Copy some parts to your Gorilla REPL, and play.

3. Choose 5 problems from [4Clojure](http://www.4clojure.com/problems), and try to solve them. If you do something interesting, share [at our Zulip stream](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/152323-data-science-course-tlv).

4. Start reading chapters 1,3,4,5,(6 if you wish),9,11,12 at Daniel Higginbotham's [Clojure for the Brave and True](https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/). Copy some parts to your Gorilla REPL, and play.

5. Watch some [videos](http://gorilla-repl.org/videos.html) about Gorilla REPL.

6. Let us talk, to share our thoughts.
