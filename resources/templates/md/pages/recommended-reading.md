## Learning Clojure
### Clojure for the Brave and True
 [This](https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/) book by Daniel Higginbotham [@nonrecursive](https://twitter.com/nonrecursive?lang=en) is an excellent way to prepare for the course. Several of us have used it as a first book for Clojure. The most relevant chapters are 1,3,4,5,(6),9,11,12.

### Clojurebridge
 [ClojureBridge](https://twitter.com/clojurebridge) is an [organization](https://clojurebridge.org/) aiming at making Clojure more accessible to underrepresented groups in tech. It has been organizing workshops in different places during the last several years.
 They wrote [this](https://clojurebridge.org/curriculum/#/) short beginner-friendly presentation.

### Practicalli Clojure
[This](https://practicalli.github.io/clojure/) is a new book by John Stevenson ([@jr0cket](https://twitter.com/jr0cket)), under construction.

It is part of the [Practical.li](http://www.practical.li/) series. You may find its first few sections useful as a guide for building your learning process and for finding other resources.

### clojinc
[This](http://viewer.gorilla-repl.org/view.html?source=github&user=lspector&repo=clojinc&path=worksheet.clj) long sequence of tiny examples is a great way to learn a lot about clojure. It was written by [Lee Spector](https://twitter.com/leespector).

## Documentation

[ClojureDoc](https://clojuredocs.org/) documents the language core.

[cljdoc](https://cljdoc.org/) documents Clojure libraries.

## Data science with Clojure
Here are some blogs to follow:
- [Squid's Blog](http://gigasquidsoftware.com/#/blog/archives/index) by [Carin Meier](https://twitter.com/carinmeier) for machine learning and artificial intelligence.
- [dragan.rocks](https://dragan.rocks/) by [Dragan Djuric](https://twitter.com/draganrocks) for linear algebra, high performance computing, etc.

### Statistics
[Andrey Romanov](https://twitter.com/izhmyh) wrote [this](https://github.com/drewnoff/openintro-gorilla-incanter) introduction to statistics with Clojure.
