This website holds general information and course materials for the Clojure Data Science Course that began in Tel Aviv towards the end of 2018.

The course is being organized by the [local meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Clojure-Israel/). Several members have been contributing to the course.

Are you a data scientist or analyst looking for new tools and new ways of thought? Are you curious to know what Clojure is? Then this free course is for you.

Are you an experienced Clojurian, curious about data science? Then you are invited too -- you will probably find this interesting and useful as well.

Clojure is a programming language. It presents a unique blend of Computer Science paradigms, mainly Lisp and Functional Programming. It also offers a certain culture of thought, which calls for simplicity, focus on data, interactive experience and a dynamic flow of creativity. The fusion of all these allows for a rather joyful programming experience.

The purpose of this course is to study Clojure as a practical tool for data science.


## Goals

- Create a study group -- a team of people willing to think and learn together.
- Have fun.
- Study new methods and tools.
- In few months, create a group of people who love to do data science using Clojure.
- Work together on improving the open source ecosystem for data science in clojure.
