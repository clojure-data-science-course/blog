**This page will update gradually. Stay tuned.**

We will work in small teams of 1-3 people, and take on small projects that match each person's special interests and background.

## Active Projects

** Note that you may still be welcome to join one of these teams. **


### Researching the ecosystem of clojure libraries
Team: **Dudu Peer**
- Web-scraping Github and Clojars

- More details soon

### Improving a library for tabular data
Team: **Amit Ramon** and **Daniel Slutsky**
