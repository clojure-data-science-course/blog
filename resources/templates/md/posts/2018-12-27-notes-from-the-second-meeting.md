On the second pair of meetings, we learned some basic machine learning.

### [Meeting A2](https://www.meetup.com/Clojure-Israel/events/257088858/) - Dec 16th 2018
This was the second meeting of **Group A** - clojure for data scientists.

We introduced [Gorilla REPL](http://gorilla-repl.org/), had some review of data structures and functions and introduced some topics like [Java-interop](https://clojure.org/reference/java_interop), working with Java arrays, [memoize](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/memoize) and [delay](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/delay).

Then, we did short demo of machine learning on dummy data with regression trees and random forests.

These [notes](http://viewer.gorilla-repl.org/view.html?source=github&user=clojure-data-science-course&repo=examples&path=src/examples/basic_machine_learning.clj) are close to what we did, with some adjustments for the sake of presentation.

ðŸŒº Special thanks to Michael Feinstein, Ella Bekerman-Vizel, Alon Vizel and Alik Peltinovich, who helped to make these notes a little better. ðŸŒº

### [Meeting B2](https://www.meetup.com/Clojure-Israel/events/257089002/) - Dec 19th 2018
This was the second meeting of **Group B** - data science for clojurians.

It began with a broad introductory talk by Alik Peltinovitch about machine learning. You can find his presentation [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1irOk_LwF-BEk5G8p7Pe3DFGaC238Iqfv/view?usp=sharing).

After some discussion, we continued with an overview of some of the workshop's projects.

Dudu Peer talked about his [project](../../pages-output/projects/#researching_the_ecosystem_of_clojure_libraries) of analysing the clojure ecosystem by web-scraping github and clojars, using [Specter](https://github.com/nathanmarz/specter) as a main tool.

Amit Ramon explained a bit about the [project](../../pages-output/projects/#improving_a_library_for_tabular_data) of improving the existing libraries for tabular data strucutres. 

Then, Amnon Heiman suggested a [project idea](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iAa37HYOLNZchHAm69nQTHjYZlfFGcezG0SNlf_Iegs/edit?usp=sharing) of extending [Prometheus.io](https://prometheus.io/) with a Clojure-based AI-layer.

On the last hour, we did a demonstration of machine learning with regression trees - similar to the one on the first group.
