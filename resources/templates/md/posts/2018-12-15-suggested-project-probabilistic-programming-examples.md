{:title "Suggested Project: Probabilistic Programming Examples"

This is the first in a series of posts, where we suggest some personal projects, that you may take on during the course. Preferably, we will do the projects in small teams of 2-3 people.

### Background

For an overview of the various projects - you may look [here](../../pages-output/projects).

[Probabilistic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_programming_language) is one of the promising and refreshing approaches to probabilistic modelling and to artificial intelligence nowadays.

It is a fascinating field, lying in the intersection of programming language theory, compilation, probability and Bayesian statistics. It calls us to put aside our usual programmer mind, and be open to new ways of thinking (in a sense, thinking backwards).

Clojure has several libraries for probabilistic programming. The main ones are [Anglican](https://probprog.github.io/anglican/), [Bayadera](https://github.com/uncomplicate/bayadera), [Distributions](https://michaellindon.github.io/software/distributions/) and [Metaprob](https://github.com/probcomp/metaprob). During our meetings, we will study a little bit of Anglican, and meet the main person behind its implementation, [David Tolpin](http://dtolpin.github.io/about/).

### The project

On this project, you will study one of those libraries, and extend its documentation by writing a series of examples.

#### Suggested tentative plan


1. Choose a probabilistic programming library. We recommend one of the following:
  - Anglican -- if you are interested in flexibility, language design and expressive power.
  - Bayadera -- if you are interested in high performance and GPU computing (note that it is rather under-documented, and may be a bit chellanging to study)

2. Choose a textbook (or parts of it) to follow through.
  - [Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers) by [Cameron Davidson-Pilon](https://twitter.com/cmrn_dp) is one good candidate, since it is very code-oriented.

3. Reading through the book, see if you can reimplement the examples.

4. Document your examples, preferably in some form of literate programming (Gorilla-REPL / Jupyter / org-mode / ...).

5. Prepare a talk about your work.

6. Write a blog post about your experience and conclusions.
